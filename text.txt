TESTIMONIALS
Straight from the Source

Life and times had become overwhelming do to the hardships my family suffered from, 
thanks to Essential Resource Consultants assistance and services I was able to be stabilized 
and will forever be appreciative.

Terrace J.

The people here @ Essential Resource Consultants were a blessing in my time of need during 
the pandemic. I couldn't find help for me and my family anywhere. I was provided with counseling, 
housing referrals, and essential items I had no other way of obtaining! A life saver!!!

​

Thank You,

Beth C.

but I just want to say thank you all for your services and support that truly made a difference!
